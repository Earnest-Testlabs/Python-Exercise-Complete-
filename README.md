# Description

In this repository, you will find various Python tasks and projects that I have completed. Each task or project is organized in its own directory, with a dedicated Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing the code, as well as any required data files or resources.

The tasks and projects cover a wide range of topics, including data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, and more. Each notebook includes detailed explanations and code comments to help you understand the implementation and the thought process behind it.

# Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebooks and execute the code, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the necessary libraries and dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file located in the root directory of this repository. You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

To run a specific task or project, navigate to the corresponding directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code and interact with the task or project.

Feel free to explore the different tasks and projects, modify the code, and experiment with your own ideas. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me.
